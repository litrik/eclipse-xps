The Eclipse XPS plug-in shows the results of JUnit test runs using the Dell XPS' built-in LEDs.

The LED colors change when the JUnit test run starts, when a test fails and when the test run completes successfully. In the plug-in's preferences you can configure colors, brightness, which LEDs should be used and whether the LEDs should pulsate (glow) during the test run.
